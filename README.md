# Image_Classification_With_CNN_Tensorflow

***Fashion MNIST*** is a dataset used in **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**, with over 70 thousand images divided into 10 different classes.

Despite bringing pre-processed images, it represents a good challenge for applying Deep Neural Networks. Specifically, it's great to demonstrate a special type of Neural Networks, known as **Convolutional Neural Networks**.

This dataset was created to replace the original MNIST dataset, where the images where handwritten digits. Among the main reasons for the change, we can mention:

* The original dataset was too easy since Convolutional Neural Networks could get to an accuracy score of 99.7% with ease.
* It didn't represent the most modern challenges in Computer Vision anymore.

> The goal of this project is to train a Convolutional Neural Network model to correctly classify the images according to their categories.
